.% Building the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.%% Using the makefile
''''''''''''''''''''''
  The makefile has only been tested with Linux and Win32 Mingw+Msys but should
work for any unix-like environment (e.g. cygwin) with the GCC toolchain.  
  
  The '<config.mk> file contains two configuration parameters:

.['|NO_ASM|]  The library contains small portions of Assembler code for i386.
              To use plain C equivalent, just uncomment the row.
              
 ['|SYS|]     It can be '|MINGW| or '|LINUX|.  It is usually autoconfigured
              by make but it can also be configured manually.
..

  From the root directory type: '|make dist| to build the library and 
the pmx tools.

  The '|dist| directory will contain all that you need to use libutl in
your project.
   
.%% Using the build scripts
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
  The '|build| directory contains scripts to build the library using other
compilers.

  The '|win_build.bat| script will try to guess the compiler that is available
and will use it to compile the library and the basic tools.

.v
    D:\projects\clibutl>cd build
    D:\projects\clibutl\build> win_build
.. 

  Currently the following compilers for Windows are supported:
  
  .[Pelles C]
   [Visual C++ Express]
   [Open Watcom]
  ..

  .> NOTE: I'm not an expert in this compilers, please suggest different
     options to make it 
  .. 

.% Using the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  There are several ways to use '|libutl| in your project.
  
  .# Link the static library '|libutl.a| '(or '|libutl.lib| or whatever
     the extension is in your system) and include the header '|libutl.h|.
     
   # Use the object files and headers you need by linking/including them
     directly.
     
   # Use '|utl.h| alone. If you just need macros for logging, debugging,
     unit tests and error handling, simply include the '|utl.h| header.
     The example in '<'|utlh.c|=examples/utl_h/utlh.c#> shows how to do it. 

   # Use '|pmx| alone. The pattern matching functions have no dependencies
     on the other functions, you can simply include '|pmx.h| and link
     '|pmx.o| to your project.    
  ..

  That said, the simplest way to use '|libutl| is just to build the
distribution files '(see next section) and copy the static library '|libutl.a|
and the header file '|libutl.h| where your compiler/linker can find them.

.% Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  For the API documentation look at the header files in the '|src| directory.

.% Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~

  I'm firmly convinced that concrete examples are much better than exhaustive
documentation that's why I provided a set of them in the '|examples| directory.

  .['|pmx2c|]      This is actually a tool that comes with the libraries.
                   It takes a C source file with embedded pmx switches and 
                   produces a plain C file ready for compilation.
                   Uses a '/bootstrap/ technique to build itself.
                     
   ['|pmxshell|]   The patterns used by pmx may be not very intuitive. This
                   tool allows you to define a set of patterns and try to
                   match a string against them.
                   A useful function to understand how a pattern works is
                   "explain" that gives a textual description of a pattern.
                   
   ['|uncomment|]  Strips a C source file from comments. It's used in the
                   build process to remove the documentation comments 
                   within the library header '|libutl.h|
                   
   ['|cxrf|]       Simply collects identifiers from a C source file and counts
                   the occurence for each.
                    
   ['|fmt|]        A light markup text formatter to extract documentation
                   from the library source file.
                   
   ['|macro|]      A simple macro system inspired by 
                   '<musicpad:http://l01c.ouvaton.org/musicpad-help.html>
